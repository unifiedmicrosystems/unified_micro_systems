### Unified.Mqtt.Pattern




##### For Internet of Things (IoT), Building Automation and System Integration





* * *



Message bus software is typically used in **system integration**, **building automation** and specifically **IoT (internet of things)** technologies with field based microcontroller integration to backend enterprise systems, this library is C# port ofÂ [RangerMauve's mqtt-pattern](https://github.com/RangerMauve/mqtt-pattern), a fast library for matching MQTT patterns with named wildcards to extract data from topics.

Our engineers developed this library for building automation, remote management and energy monitoring solutions that have been actively deployed in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) and Manila (Philippines).
