When you are looking for shared web hosting, chances are that finding service providers would not be difficult at all. On the contrary, you are more likely to be spoilt for choice and have a hard time deciding which company to work with. A staggering number of companies provide shared web hosting services of different kinds. Most of these companies use a concept to market their services and lure customers in, and they call it “Unlimited Hosting.” They frequently adorn their service offer by including phrases like “Unlimited Disk Space” and “Unlimited Bandwidth”.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":635,"offset":635},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":635,"offset":635},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you think this is too good to be true, rest assured- it is.

The fair use policy outlines the limits you have on disk space and bandwidth on your account and states that exceeding those limits might lead to penalties.

Web hosts take advantage of this situation by glamorizing the capabilities of a server, and hyping up its capacity of maybe two or three hundred users, while it is only meant to be used by a hundred for optimal performance.
